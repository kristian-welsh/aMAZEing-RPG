This project is being created for submission as part of an assignment for a foundation course in computer science.

All code is entirely the work of Kristian John Welsh unless otherwise noted.

This project is intended to be a flash game to be published on online agregators of flash games.

Intended Feature List
---------------------
- Procedural Level generation.
- Top-down view of a controlable player character.
- Artificialy intelegent enemy characters traversing the generated level with the player character.
- Character collision with walls in the generated level.
- Player character enters a fight interface on colision with another character.
- Both characters in the fight have a certain amount of "health" and will die, ending the fight, if this is reduced to zero through the other character's actions.
- The fight interface allows the player to select actions for the player character to perform during the fight such as "attack", "heal", or "run".
- The enemy character is controlled by Artificial Intelegence with the same options as the player but with lesser effect.
- A success screen is displayed upon successful navigation to the level's exit, and a failure screen upon the death of the player character.
